# What this is about {-}

This book is intended to serve as a companion to [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (ISLR) and reimplement the R programs using primarily [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages and a tidy design philosophy. It is not intended to stand on its own or review the statistical learning concepts from ISLR. It is not intended to teach R programming or computational problem solving in general. For that, I recommend any number of online resources including Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and the materials from my graduate course on [Computing for the Social Sciences](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/).
